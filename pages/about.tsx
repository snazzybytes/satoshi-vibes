          Welcome to Satoshi Vibes, the quote wiki for Satoshi Nakamoto. If you've made it here, you
          must be in the middle of your Bitcoin journey. As you go down deeper the infinite rabbit
          hole üêáüï≥, you will be curious to see what Satoshi was saying on cypherpunk forums back in
          the years of 2008, 2009, and 2010 before he disappeared forever. It's nice to get a little
          taste of how it all started and learn about the impetus for the ideas that culminated in
          creation of Bitcoin a.k.a hardest money on earth. On the home page you will find 24 quote
          categories to choose from. Each category is sorted by published date in descending order
          (for now). Let this be a quick reference for Satoshi's quotes you can pull up on your
          mobile or desktop as you orange pill your friends and family. That's it for now, dive in
          üßê!

          I quickly put this site together while sitting home one weekend and exploring{" "}
          <Link href="https://nextjs.org/">NextJS</Link>. I work as a software engineer in
          e-commerce world dealing with backend systems in large enteprise setting and don't get to
          play with the frontend dev that much. However I felt compelled to provide some educational
          value to the world while I'm at it. There is always a new wave of bitcoin plebs awakening,
          ready to step inside the mind of Satoshi once they truly realize that something is wrong
          with the fiat world we live in üí∏ü™¶. The least I could do is pay homage to Bitcoin and
          spread its ethos out into the universe (inspired by{" "}

          The site is fully open source, just like everything I used to put it together (credits on
          Github). If you are a dev and want to add more pages, Bitcoin resources or learning
          materials, improve the NextJS layout or react components, or just spice things up and make
          this site a lot cooler for all the plebs - you are very welcome to{" "}
