            Welcome to Satoshi Vibes, the "Satoshi Nakamoto" quote wiki. If you've made it here, you
            must be in the middle of your Bitcoin journey. As you go down deeper the infinite rabbit
            hole üêáüï≥, you will be curious to read up on what Satoshi was saying on cypherpunk forums
            back in the years of 2008, 2009, and 2010 before he disappeared forever. It's nice to
            get a taste of how it all started and learn about the impetus for the ideas that
            culminated in creation of Bitcoin aka hardest money in the world. On the home page you
            will find 24 quote categories to choose from. Each category is sorted by published date
            in descending order (for now). Let this be a quick reference for Satoshi's quotes you
            can pull up on your mobile/tablet/desktop as you orange pill your family and friends.
